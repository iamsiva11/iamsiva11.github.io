Hello world, this is Siva Sundaramoorthy. I love working on machine learning and building things. Professionally, I'm an applied machine learning research engineer. I want to understand things clearly, and explain them well - on the work I do on AI. I believe this blog would help me achieve both. 

Predominantly, I spend most of my time on Deep learning approaches to Natural language understanding(NLU). And sometimes fiddling with Vision, RL, speech problems. Futhermore, my [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/siva-sundaramoorthy) page has much more information.
